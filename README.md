### My tech knowledge so far:

+ 🏗️ Building continuous integration pipelines (here goes Jenkins, Travis, Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Drone.io).
+ 👀 Monitoring. It's a complicated but vital topic. First hand experience with Nagios & similar systems.
+ 📈 Logging, observability, and data flow. Familiar with ELK, able to make apps speak JSON, also familiar with Prometheus and Grafana.
+ 📦 Maintaining container runtime engines. Kubernetes, docker, podman, everything that makes life easier.
+ 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code. Had worked with Puppet, Ansible, Terraform; personally prefer plain old Makefiles.

### What else I am familiar with:

+ ☁️  AWS (the whole CRUD stack starting with ELB, ECS in the middle, and a variety of services around)
+ 💻 Various flavours of Linux distributions(currently preferring Debian and Ubuntu, had also worked with CentOS)
+ 💽 DBMS. Mostly MySQL, had worked with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
+ 🎰 Queue services. Had worked with RabbitMQ and beanstalkd, running my own queue engine FSMQ
+ 🌐 Web servers and load balancers. Broad experience of working with NGINX and HAProxy, dipping my toes into Envoy waters.
+ ⚙️  Kubernetes. That, I think, does not need any introduction.
+ 🕸 Istio. Already 3 years into this thing and still learning.

### That's all, folks!
